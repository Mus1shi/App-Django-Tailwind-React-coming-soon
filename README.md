#  Tokugawa - Gourmet Restaurant Website (WIP)

**Tokugawa** is a web application currently in development for a high-end Japanese restaurant. The project is based on a modern architecture combining **Django (Python)** for the backend and **React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS**, and **Material UI (MUI)** for the frontend. It aims to deliver a smooth, responsive, and elegant user experience, with dynamic and advanced features.

---

##  Current Status: In Progress

The site was initially built entirely using **classic Django** with **HTML/CSS templates** and **Tailwind CSS** to quickly validate the structure, views, database models, and core backend features.

This initial version allowed for:

-  Implementing Django models and business logic  
-  Testing forms, gallery, comment section, and routing  
-  Prototyping a consistent responsive design using Tailwind CSS  

---

## Why Move to React + TypeScript?

The migration to **React + TypeScript** at this stage is motivated by:

- **Backend stability**: Django logic is fully operational, allowing a clean decoupled frontend through a REST API  
- **Modular architecture**: React offers better separation of components and flexible state management (forms, filters, comments)  
- **Enhanced UX**: Features like image carousels, real-time comment updates, and menu filtering are better handled with React  
- **Continued use of Tailwind CSS**: Fast and consistent styling across the application  
- **Scalability**: A React + TypeScript base opens the door for a SPA or PWA version

- Pages: Home, Reservations, Menu, Story, Contact  
- Models: Dishes, Categories, Reservations, Chefs, Comments  
- Static image gallery
